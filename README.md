# Athenaeum
For module 2 project, I'm making a lite streaming service.
I can't actually access any of the videos. Athenaeum is very lite.

## For anyone wondering.
Athenaeum was a temple that was build by a Roman emperor. I forget 
which one. He built it in honor of the goddess Athena and it was frequented
by the academics of its time. I chose it because I didn't want to use Library and it
sounds cool

## Atheneaum App hierarchy
Components:
    

## Further Plans
I'll keep building on this project until it mirrors a full streaming service minus the videos. I'll try and find a way to add trailers instead.
